## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Preparing for next release

## [1.2.0] - 2025-07-25

### Added
- üéØ **Advanced 7-Validator i18n System** - Complete rewrite with specialized validators
  - **Validator 1**: JSX Text Content (HIGH) - Direct text in JSX elements
  - **Validator 2**: User-facing JSX Attributes (HIGH) - alt, title, placeholder, label attributes  
  - **Validator 3**: User Message Variables (HIGH) - Variables with semantic names (*Message, *Text, *Label)
  - **Validator 4**: User-facing Object Properties (MEDIUM) - Object properties with semantic keys
  - **Validator 5**: Form Validation Messages (MEDIUM) - Validation error and success messages
  - **Validator 6**: Component Props (MEDIUM) - Props passed to React components vs HTML attributes
  - **Validator 7**: Alert Messages (MEDIUM) - User-facing alert(), confirm(), prompt() (excludes console.log)

- üîç **Smart Detection Features**
  - Whitelist-based approach prevents false positives from technical strings
  - Component vs HTML element distinction for accurate prop/attribute classification
  - Technical string filtering (CSS classes, API endpoints, debug messages, paths)
  - Natural language pattern detection with content validation
  - Zero false positives for technical identifiers like "react", "primary", "hovered"

- üéØ **Path Targeting Capability**
  - Analyze specific directories: `node cli.js /path/to/project/src/components i18n`
  - Single file analysis: `node cli.js /path/to/project/file.tsx i18n`
  - Focused analysis for large projects with `--path` option
  - CLI enhancements for targeted translation work

- üèóÔ∏è **Modular Validator Architecture**
  - Separate validator files under `src/plugins/i18n-extractor/validators/`
  - BaseValidator abstract class with consistent interface
  - ValidatorRegistry for centralized management
  - Easy to extend with additional validators

- üìä **Enhanced Output & Reporting**
  - Detailed categorization by validator type (jsx-text, component-prop, alert-message, etc.)
  - Priority-based recommendations (HIGH/MEDIUM priority)
  - JSON output format with complete metadata
  - Comprehensive documentation with examples

### Improved  
- **False Positive Prevention**: Eliminated detection of technical strings through sophisticated whitelist approach
- **Component Detection**: Smart distinction between React component props and HTML attributes
- **Performance**: Modular architecture improves maintainability and performance
- **Documentation**: Complete validator system documentation with examples and usage patterns

### Technical
- Modular validator system with registry pattern
- Enhanced AST analysis with context-aware detection
- Comprehensive test coverage with demo files for each validator
- Clean separation of concerns between validation logic and AST traversal
